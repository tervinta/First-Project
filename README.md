# Fetching-Baseball
In this project as a team we used API's to create a stats sharing website primarily for Baseball/Football Teams. The website had young adults in mind that need to see seasonal history for teams they may want to (bet on/create fantasy teams).

# Functionality
The Team selecting form is shown at the top right of the website.
When a correct team abbreviation is entered example-"KC" the user gets shown City, League Country which is set as NA or North America, Runs Scored, and Losses.
This information is also stored within a column under the Get Teams Button that can be cleared by clicking the Clear button, the text for the event is saved in local storage once the save button for that time block is clicked.
The stored events endure when the page is refreshed.

For our second API below the permeated red column click the button Get List of All Sports and it will popup a modal that says "Enter the sport title:" 
for this you want to enter either "Baseball" or "Football" then click submit to see data.

Below you'll see the print odds you'll see three criteria to fill out including: "Enter the sports key: baseball_mlb or americanfootball
Options: baseball_mlb, americanfootball Enter the region: Options: uk, us, us2, eu, au Enter the market:" after filling this information click submit to see data.
